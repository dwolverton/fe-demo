# Git Commands Cheat Sheet

### Upload a new project

1. On the command line...

   1. `cd` into the lab folder.
   2. `git init` to initialize the local Git repository. Only do this one time per project!
   3. `git add .` to add all the files in the project to the staging area. Or `git add <file/folder>` to add a specific file or folder. Include the name or path of the file or folder. Do not include the angle brackets (<, >).
   4. `git commit -m 'initial commit'` to make the first commit.

2. On GitHub.com, log in and create a new repository. Give it a name, such as "Lab2", and leave all the other options as they are.

3. Copy both lines under "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line" on GitHub, paste them on the command line, and press ENTER.

4. Refresh the GitHub page to verify that your files have been copied up.

### Add changes to an existing project

On the command line...

1. `git add .` to add all changes in the project to the staging area.
2. `git commit -m 'Describe change'` - but replace Describe Change with your own description of the change you're making. Be sure to put the single-quotes around it as in this example.
3. `git push` to copy the commit to GitHub.
4. (optional) Go to GitHub.com and check that your changes are there.

1. `ESC`
2. `:` (Hold `SHIFT` and press the `:` key)
3. `x`
4. `ENTER`

Here's what it looks like...
